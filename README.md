# Pocket-Doctor

TreeHacks 2023 Project

This repository contains the files for our AI asistant, Doc. Doc is based off of chatGPT's chatbot. Doc is designed to questions about medical concerns and provide feedback and recommendations based on its knowledge in addition to user data inputted during the account creation process and user wellness logs. 

Ideally, we would feed Doc with more health data so that it can be more accurate than chatGPT's chatbot. However, due to limited time, we were only able to implement chatGPT's large language model, which while it may have inaccuracies or be out of date, still should be on par or better than a Google search.
